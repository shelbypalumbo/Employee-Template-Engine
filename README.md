Still a work in progress, all tests pass, but their is broken code and cards do not display propperly.

## User Story
As an Employer, I want to be able to display each employees name, role, and contact information, so that I can refer to a specific employee.

User will be prompted for their employees name, id, email, role, and additional parameters based on what they select as their role (Manager, Enginer, Intern).
Once all prompts are answered for all employees, each employees card will append to an html file and generate a full web page displaying the companies employees.
